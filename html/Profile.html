    <h1>BIO</h1>
<h1>Welcome to The Last Information About Me!</h1>
<h2>This Information is Written By: Angelo Eustaquio</h2>
<p>I definitely want to be an IT. Not because the salary is substanial amount, but because this is what i want to be. over the past few weeks, I was thinking what would i be in the future. And suddenly i think, What if i should find the things i have interest and urge me to do even repeating the same thing. The next Day i saw a video that is about learning HTML so i was thinking if this is the sign. Although it seem's hard on my first impression but now look i made my own website with the help of internet, free cources and tips. I feel that this is the thing i want to be, I know im still far a head to become a successful IT. But i will pursue it. Soon i will be an IT. But now, I will stll continueing expanding my knowledge not only on programming but also in academics and soon i would achieve every piece of my dream. 
    and lastly. by the weeks i was learning how to code, i feel this is really i want to be. it eligble me to enjoy while suffering to do it, but thats the life. Now that i already found out my interest, This interest shall significantly improve my knowledge and expand it. By the time come's all of my diligence will pay off. Just always remember this is your dream,your interest, and your self do what ever you want, i will always do it all the time. Regardless of the Challenge i will face. For my Dream and Future Wife, children and for me.
